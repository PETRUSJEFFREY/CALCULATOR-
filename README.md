The **Calculator Project using HTML and CSS** is a beginner-to-intermediate level front-end web development project that focuses on designing a functional and visually appealing calculator interface. This project serves as a great exercise to understand the structure of HTML and the styling capabilities of CSS, while preparing the foundation for JavaScript integration if functionality is added later.

The **HTML** portion of the project is responsible for structuring the calculator layout. It typically includes a display area to show input and results, along with multiple buttons for digits (0–9), operations (such as +, −, ×, ÷), and functional keys like equals (=), clear (C), and decimal (.). These buttons are arranged in a grid layout, providing users with a simple and familiar interface.

The **CSS** styling is used to enhance the visual appearance of the calculator. Styles are applied to give the calculator a modern look using background colors, button hover effects, border radius for rounded buttons, box shadows for depth, and a responsive layout that adjusts to different screen sizes. CSS Grid or Flexbox is often used to align the buttons evenly and maintain consistency across the design.

This project not only improves understanding of layout design and visual hierarchy but also demonstrates the separation of concerns between structure (HTML) and style (CSS). Though this version may not include JavaScript, it prepares learners to later add interactive functionality such as capturing button clicks, performing calculations, and updating the display in real-time.

The calculator project is ideal for students and beginners looking to improve their front-end skills. It can be extended with advanced features like keyboard input, themes (light/dark mode), history of operations, and responsive mobile design. Overall, it’s a practical, foundational project for anyone starting out in web development.
